<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Euskalbar** is a browser extension designed to facilitate the translation of words and phrases between Basque and other languages.
Born out of a passion for promoting the Basque language and making it more accessible to a global audience, Euskalbar aims to provide a seamless translation experience for users.

### Features

* Multiple Dictionaries: Access a variety of dictionaries and resources to get the most accurate translations.
* User-friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface ensures users can easily navigate and use the extension.
* Customizable Settings: Tailor the extension's behavior according to your preferences.
* Statistics & Analytics: Gain insights into your translation habits and frequently used dictionaries.

### Motivation

The Basque language, known as Euskara, is one of the oldest languages still spoken today.
With a rich history and unique linguistic characteristics, it's a treasure that deserves preservation and promotion.
Euskalbar is our contribution to this cause, aiming to bridge the gap between the Basque language and the world.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To be able to test the extension, you need Mozilla's web-ext [![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/web-ext.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext).
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install web-ext@latest -g
  ```

### Testing the extension

1. Go inside the ``src`` folder of the downloaded code.
2. Run ``web-ext run`` ([more info on the web-ext tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext))

### Building the extension

You can create the extension file in one of two ways:

* ``zip -r ../euskalbar-0.0.zip *``. You will get a ZIP file named "euskalbar-0.0.zip" (change the 0.0 part of the name to what you need; the real version number is defined in the "src/manifest.json" file).
* ``web-ext build -a ..``. You will get a ZIP file named "euskalbar-0.0.zip", with the real version number defined in the "src/manifest.json" file instead of the 0.0 part of the name).

The built extension can be installed and run in Developer Edition, Nightly, and ESR versions of Firefox, after toggling the "xpinstall.signatures.required" preference in "about:config".

For installation in any Firefox, extension has to be signed ([more info here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Distribution)).

_Below are the instructions on how to download and test the extension in Firefox Developer Edition._

1. Clone the repo and enter the root folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/euskalbar/euskalbar.git
   ```
2. Go to `src` folder
   ```sh
   cd src
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Test the extension
   ```sh
   web-ext run
   ```
   ([more info on the web-ext tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext))

### Building the Extension

The extension can be zipped to a file with the web-ext NPM package.

```sh
web-ext build -a ..
```
